# Sigrow
Sigrow Stomata camera interfacing - from now on you can get stored images, both RGB and thermal, build your object detection tool to define your points of interest and by known coordinates to pull temperature values from thermal image.

I have started to build arround Sigrow Stomatal camera our own tools for cucumber head tmeperature detection. I will upload notebooks if I will find something worth sharing. So far we have collected available RGB images for object classification, I will include that part of ode as well.
